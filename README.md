# Class 12 CS Final Project
This is the final project that I submitted and one that didn't get approved for submission because of extra packages used. The project is basically a student data base management system, that is just glorious words for adding and storing data about students test marks, dates, subjects, test type(subjective/objective) etc.

# main.py
This is the file that didn't get approved because of use of tkinter library.

# reconfig_main.py
This is the file that i submitted. This was created within 6-7 hours. This was made using mysql, python
